# sd-webui-noise-color-picker

This is practically a fork of [diffusion-noise-alternatives](https://github.com/Seshelle/diffusion-noise-alternatives-webui) and actually has far fewer features. 

In comparison this extension is:
- Much faster
- Works in Forge

## TODO

- Illustration images
- Would be nice to improve on the UI
